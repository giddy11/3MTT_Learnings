 * ### Summary Description of the Project:

**Project Name:** Medicine Availability Tracker  
**Purpose:**  
The Medicine Availability Tracker is a web-based platform designed to address the challenge of finding specific medicines quickly and efficiently. The platform serves two types of users:
1. **General Users**: They can search for nearby pharmacies stocking required medicines.
2. **Pharmacies**: They can list their available medicines and manage their inventory.

**Problem Statement:**  
Patients often struggle to locate pharmacies that have the medicines they need in stock, especially during emergencies. This inefficiency can delay treatment and impact health outcomes.

**Solution:**  
The platform bridges this gap by:
- Allowing users to search for specific medicines.
- Providing a list of pharmacies with the required medicine, including contact and address details.
- Enabling pharmacies to update their inventory in real time for better transparency and accuracy.

**Future Features:**  
- Integration of a **map-based search** to show nearby pharmacies visually.
- Real-time **inventory updates** with automated low-stock alerts.
- **Notification system** for users when their requested medicine becomes available.
- A **review system** for users to rate pharmacies.
- **Mobile-friendly design** for better accessibility.

### Challenges Faced While Building the Solution:

1. **Handling User Authentication:**  
   - **Challenge:** Managing distinct workflows for two user types (general users and pharmacies) while ensuring secure data storage.  
   - **Solution:** Developed a clear logic for user roles and stored data securely using `localStorage` (with plans for a backend in the future).  

2. **Dynamic User Interfaces:**  
   - **Challenge:** Dynamically displaying dashboards and features based on the logged-in user's type (search box for users, inventory management for pharmacies).  
   - **Solution:** Utilized JavaScript to toggle views and ensure the appropriate dashboard is rendered upon login.  

3. **Medicine Search Logic:**  
   - **Challenge:** Ensuring accurate matching of medicine search queries with pharmacy inventories.  
   - **Solution:** Created a filter function to match user input with a sample list of pharmacy inventories (to be scaled with real data).
